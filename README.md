# Climate Forecasting
Using a time-series dataset of the Delhi climate from 2013 - 2017 to forecast new results, with the time-series being recorded on a daily basis. The features present in this data set that we will be predicting and using to predict are mean temperature, humidity and wind speed. We will be training and comparing 3 different machine learning approaches to forecasting problems in ARIMA modeling, XGBoosting and LSTMs.
